# CDA - Coastal Dynamics Analyzer
![CDA_Icon](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c9c0008-fc65-4a0b-8c1e-530d627069ee)

Studies of shoreline evolution are crucial for assessing beach accretion or retreat, influencing erosion 
management strategies and coastal hazard adaptation plans. With the advent of GIS technologies and 
satellite imagery, analyses of coastal dynamics have become faster and more accurate. However, there 
are still no plugins for QGIS that fully automate these analyses based on Transect-Based Analysis (TBA) 
methods. 
The Coastal Dynamics Analyzer (CDA) is a new plugin for QGIS, developed to provide an automatic 
method for Shoreline Change Analysis (SCA), improving the accuracy and speed of the analysis. 
The CDA plugin is written in PyQGIS (version v.1.0.0). It allows you to define a piecewise polynomial 
baseline and generate transects for shoreline change analysis. CDA allows commonly used rate-of
change such as End Point Rate (EPR), Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), Shoreline Change Envelope 
(SCE), and Linear Regression Rate (LRR) to be calculated, providing reports in .csv and shapefile 
formats. 
Easily installed using the QGIS plugin manager or as a Python script, the plugin is based on QGIS 
algorithms and scientific libraries. It provides an intuitive environment for analysing coastal transects 
and, due to its speed and accuracy, make it suitable for regional studies and for providing parameters 
needed for erosion management strategies. In addition, CDA is distinguished by its ability to perform 
detailed and automated analyses, supporting the scientific community, industry professionals, and coastal 
managers in monitoring coastal changes, identifying erosion-prone areas, and evaluating the 
effectiveness of mitigation measures.
